# PocketBase MCP Server

A very much in progress MCP server based off of the Dynamics one that I have been testing and refining. That provides sophisticated tools for interacting with PocketBase databases. This server enables advanced database operations, schema management, and data manipulation through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

Here is a video of me using it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuTIO3I7rTM&t=345s

## Why This And Not DynamicsEndpoints?

This has actually been tested on the latest version. Currently 26.1 of PocketBase and is built off of the type definitions in the JS-SDK and not the arbitrary and wrong definitions found in the Dynamics one. Many of the methods don't even work.

## Setup MCP Server Locally (Only Way Supported for Now)

To set up the MCP server locally, you'll need to configure it within your `cline_mcp_settings.json` or whatever you use (claude, cursor, the config looks identical you just need to find where it is stored) file. Here's how:

1.  **Locate your `cline_mcp_settings.json` file:** This file is usually located in your Cursor user settings directory. For example:
    `/Users/yourusername/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json`

2.  **Configure the server:** Add a new entry to the `mcpServers` object in your `cline_mcp_settings.json` file. The key should be a unique name for your server (e.g., "pocketbase-server"), and the value should be an object containing the server's configuration.

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "pocketbase-server": {
          "command": "node",
          "args": ["build/index.js"],
          "env": {
            "POCKETBASE_URL": "http://127.0.0.1:8090",
            "POCKETBASE_ADMIN_EMAIL": "admin@example.com",
            "POCKETBASE_ADMIN_PASSWORD": "admin_password"
          },
          "disabled": false,
          "autoApprove": ["create_record", "create_collection"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    - **`command`**: The command to start the server (usually `node`).
    - **`args`**: An array of arguments to pass to the command. This should point to the compiled JavaScript file of your MCP server (e.g., `build/index.js`). Make sure the path is correct.
    - **`env`**: An object containing environment variables.
      - **`POCKETBASE_URL`**: The URL of your PocketBase instance. This is _required_.
      - **`POCKETBASE_ADMIN_EMAIL`**: The admin email for your PocketBase instance (optional, but needed for some operations).
      - **`POCKETBASE_ADMIN_PASSWORD`**: The admin password for your PocketBase instance (optional, but needed for some operations).
    - **`disabled`**: Whether to disable to server on startup.
    - **`autoApprove`**: list of tools to auto approve.
    - Adjust the values in the `env` object to match your PocketBase instance's settings.

- Setup in vscode is similar , find or create `.vscode/mcp.json` and add

```json
{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "type": "promptString",
      "id": "pocketbase-admin-email",
      "description": "PocketBase Admin Email",
      "password": false
    },
    {
      "type": "promptString",
      "id": "pocketbase-admin-password",
      "description": "PocketBase Admin Password",
      "password": true
    }
  ],
  "servers": {
    "pocketbaseServer": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "node",
      // replace this with the path to your compiled MCP server (git clone the repo and run `npm run build` to compile)
      "args": ["~/Desktop/code/mcp/pocketbase-mcp/build/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "POCKETBASE_URL": "http://127.0.0.1:8090",
        "POCKETBASE_ADMIN_EMAIL": "${input:pocketbase-admin-email}",
        "POCKETBASE_ADMIN_PASSWORD": "${input:pocketbase-admin-password}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

1.  **Start the server:** After configuring the `cline_mcp_settings.json` file, you can start using the MCP server with the configured tools.

## Setup MCP Server with Docker

You can run the PocketBase MCP server using Docker. A `Dockerfile` is included in the repository.

### Building the Docker Image

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t pocketbase-mcp .
```

### Running the Docker Container

```bash
# Run the container with environment variables
docker run -d \
  --name pocketbase-mcp \
  -e POCKETBASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8090 \
  -e POCKETBASE_ADMIN_EMAIL=your_admin@example.com \
  -e POCKETBASE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_admin_password \
  pocketbase-mcp
```

### Docker MCP Configuration

To use the Dockerized MCP server with your AI assistant (Cursor, Claude, etc.), configure it in your MCP settings:

**For Cline/Cursor (`cline_mcp_settings.json`):**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pocketbase-docker": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e",
        "POCKETBASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:8090",
        "-e",
        "POCKETBASE_ADMIN_EMAIL=your_admin@example.com",
        "-e",
        "POCKETBASE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_admin_password",
        "pocketbase-mcp"
      ],
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": ["list_collections", "list_records", "get_collection"]
    }
  }
}
```

**For VS Code (`.vscode/mcp.json`):**

```json
{
  "inputs": [
    {
      "type": "promptString",
      "id": "pocketbase-admin-email",
      "description": "PocketBase Admin Email",
      "password": false
    },
    {
      "type": "promptString",
      "id": "pocketbase-admin-password",
      "description": "PocketBase Admin Password",
      "password": true
    }
  ],
  "servers": {
    "pocketbaseDocker": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e",
        "POCKETBASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:8090",
        "-e",
        "POCKETBASE_ADMIN_EMAIL=${input:pocketbase-admin-email}",
        "-e",
        "POCKETBASE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=${input:pocketbase-admin-password}",
        "pocketbase-mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Docker Configuration Notes

- **`-i`**: Interactive mode (required for stdio communication)
- **`--rm`**: Automatically remove container when it exits
- **`host.docker.internal`**: Use this to access PocketBase running on your host machine from within Docker
- **Environment Variables**: Replace placeholder values with your actual PocketBase credentials
- **Network**: If your PocketBase is also running in Docker, use Docker networking (e.g., `--network host` or custom bridge network)

### Docker Compose (Optional)

Create a `docker-compose.yml` for easier management:

```yaml
version: "3.8"

services:
  pocketbase-mcp:
    build: .
    environment:
      - POCKETBASE_URL=http://host.docker.internal:8090
      - POCKETBASE_ADMIN_EMAIL=your_admin@example.com
      - POCKETBASE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_admin_password
    stdin_open: true
    tty: true
```

Then configure your MCP settings to use:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pocketbase-docker": {
      "command": "docker-compose",
      "args": ["run", "--rm", "pocketbase-mcp"],
      "disabled": false
    }
  }
}
```
